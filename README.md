# Berkeley AUTOLAB's Dex-Net Package

Documentation: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/code.html

Project website: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net

## Overview
The dex-net Python package is for opening, reading, and writing HDF5 databases of 3D object models, parallel-jaw grasps, and grasp robustness metrics.

The HDF5 databases can be used to generate massive datasets associating tuples of point clouds and grasps with binary grasp robustness labels to train [Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Networks (GQ-CNNs)](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/gqcnn) to predict robustness of candidate grasps from point clouds.

This package is part of the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) project: https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net. Created and maintained by the AUTOLAB at UC Berkeley: https://autolab.berkeley.edu

## Installation
See the website at [https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/code.html](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/code.html) for installation instructions and API Documentation.

## Datasets
The Dex-Net Object Mesh Dataset v1.1 and Dex-Net 2.0 HDF5 database can be downloaded from [the data repository](http://bit.ly/2uh07i9).
